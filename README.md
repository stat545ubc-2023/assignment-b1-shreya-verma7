## Overview

The project is a part of UBC course [*STAT 545B*](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545b/). The goal is to write clean and reproducible code for data analysis using R and GitHub workflow. The focus is to write functions, advanced data computation, use of various R packages, and distribute data. Course assignment is bifurcated; progress as of 10/28/2023:

-   [x] Assignment B1
    -   Creating and fortifying a function
    -   Function documentation
    -   Function testing and explanation
-   [ ] Assignment B2
    -   Initial release expected by 11/10/2023

## Current Project Files

1.  [*Assignment-1*](/Assignment-1.md): file rendered in Github friendly format.

## Code execution

The code can be run from file [*Assignment-1*](/Assignment-1.Rmd) using `R` software along with additional packages such as `tidyverse`, `devtools`, and specifically `test_that`. Using an IDE such as `RStudio` carries out this task easily.
